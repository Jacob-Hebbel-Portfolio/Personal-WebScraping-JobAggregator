# Job Posting Scraper
### A Project by Jacob Hebbel

## Introduction
This project collects job postings from Indeed, LinkedIn, and ZipRecruiter using a Scrapy Web Scraper. Information on each posting is saved to a Mongo Database. In the future this will be integrated with Elastic. This project makes every effort to stay on the legal side of web scraping.
