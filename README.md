# Job Posting Scraper
### A Project by Jacob Hebbel

## Introduction
This project collects job postings from Indeed, LinkedIn, and ZipRecruiter using a Scrapy Web Scraper. Information on each posting is saved to a Mongo Database. In the future this will be integrated with Elastic. This project makes every effort to stay on the legal side of web scraping.


## Usage
To ensure accurate results, please use python 3.x

First, install the necessary pip packages. Run the following in the project root. I suggest you use a virtual environment as well

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To run the individual scrapers, navigate to the spiderDriver file and run it

```python spiderDriver.py```
